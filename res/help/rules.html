	<h1>Matching</h1>
	<p>
		A tile must be free, meaning, a tile cannot have a tile directly above it,
		or a tile may not have a left and right neighbor.		
	</p>
	<p>
		A tile must also match the second tile being selected*. For example,
		a numbered Bamboo 2 tile can match with another numbered Bamboo 2 tile, but not a 
		Circle 2 tile.
		<br><br>
		There are two exceptions to this matching rule.  The season tiles (spring, fall, summer, winter)
		can match with any season tile. The flower tiles (plum, orchid, chrysanthemum, bamboo) can match 
		with any other flower tile.
